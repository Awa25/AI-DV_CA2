    "- Definition: A tree is a special type of graph. A tree is an undirected graph in which any two nodes are connected by exactly one path, and there are no cycles. A graph, in contrast, can have any number of paths connecting nodes and can include cycles.\n",
    "- Nodes and Edges: In a tree, the number of edges is always one less than the number of nodes. In a generic graph, there can be any number of edges.\n",
    "- Root: Trees typically have a specific node called the \"root\" from which hierarchical structures descend. Graphs do not have a designated root.\n",
    "- Path: In a tree, there's exactly one unique path between any two nodes. In a graph, there can be multiple paths, or even none at all, between two nodes.\n",
    "- Cycles: Trees cannot have cycles, whereas cycles can be present in graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Fig. 1 is a graph. It has cycles and multiple paths between nodes indicating it is not a tree, trees don't have cycles, and there are unique paths between any two nodes."
