    "- Definition: A tree is a special type of graph. A tree is an undirected graph in which any two nodes are connected by exactly one path, and there are no cycles. A graph, in contrast, can have any number of paths connecting nodes and can include cycles.\n",
    "- Nodes and Edges: In a tree, the number of edges is always one less than the number of nodes. In a generic graph, there can be any number of edges.\n",
    "- Root: Trees typically have a specific node called the \"root\" from which hierarchical structures descend. Graphs do not have a designated root.\n",
    "- Path: In a tree, there's exactly one unique path between any two nodes. In a graph, there can be multiple paths, or even none at all, between two nodes.\n",
    "- Cycles: Trees cannot have cycles, whereas cycles can be present in graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Fig. 1 is a graph. It has cycles and multiple paths between nodes indicating it is not a tree, trees don't have cycles, and there are unique paths between any two nodes."

Refer to the complexity of the algorithms and compare the actual time it takes for the solutions to be processed."
